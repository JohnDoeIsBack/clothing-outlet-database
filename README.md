# SIGMA FASHION OUTLET
In this project we are going to build a database system for a clothing outlet called Sigma. We will build an efficient but a simple database system that Sigma can use to manage their day to day operations. We will also make ER(Entity Relation) diagram and related diagrams that will show the relation between each tables in an easy way. We will also develop queries to build the database that we designed. We will also develop queries which we can use to perform various operations and get results based on the question.  

# PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Sigma is a clothing outlet which have many branches across the country. They want us to build a Database System which they can use to store the information about their customers, the inventory (information regarding their clothes such as its price, brand and etc.), the membership details about their customers, the bill information and the discount information. Sigma also wants to view results on questions regarding their customers, inventory(such as price of a product, the purchase history of a customer, etc.).

# WHAT WILL WE BUILD:
1) A description of each tables and their realtionship with other tables, their datatypes, the values and columns. 
2) ER diagram and related diagrams to understand the database better.
3) Queries to build the actual database.
4) Queries to get results on questions asked by Sigma.

# WHAT WILL WE NOT BUILD:
1) Any real time application
2) UI(User Interface)

# THE DATABASE WILL BE DEVELOPED ON PostgreSQL.
